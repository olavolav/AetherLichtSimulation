# AetherLicht simulator

This is a [Processing](https://processing.org) script to see how the AetherLicht installation would look like.

Once `processing-java` is installed via the Processing IDE, the script can be run via:
```
processing-java --sketch=/Users/olav/Desktop/AetherLicht/AetherLichtSimulation --run
```

Alternatively, use a package like `processing` for Atom to run sketches directly from the editor.
